This repo contains a clone of the official FDB package that has been modified to work with Python 2.3
Note that some tests do not pass and it's possible some fdb features do not work

FDB package is a set of Firebird RDBMS bindings for Python. It works on Python 2.6+ and Python 3.x.

FDB is replacement for discontinued KInterbasDB library, and as such it's designed to be as much compatible 
with KInterbasDB as possible, but there are some differences. See FDB documentation for full description 
of these differences.
